This folder contains a Streamlit app for the Midrash Style Classification project. 

## Requirements

The app requires two model files to run:

- `style_normal_logistic_1_3.pkl`
- `style_normal_logistic_vec_1_3.pkl`

Ensure these files are in the same directory as the Streamlit app.

## Running the App

Once you have the model files, you can run the app using the following command:
`streamlit run app.py`
